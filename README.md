# WPSS Validation Tool version 3.7.0

The WPSS Validation Tool provides web developers and quality assurance testers the ability to perform a number of web site and web page validation tasks at one time. The tool crawls a site to find all of the documents then analyses each document with a number of validation tools.

Version 3.7.0 contains the following updates and additions
 - The 'Content' results tab is renamed to 'Department' and includes all departmental checks, results file suffix is _dept.txt.  The 'CLF' tab only contains look and feel (CLF 2.0 or Usability) checks.
 - Accept new href values in the GC footer of the Web Usability look.
 - Don't treat a redirect from www.domain.com to domain.com (or vice versa) as a redirect link.
 - All configuration tab settings (e.g. CLF profile, metadata profile) can be saved & loaded from site profiles.
