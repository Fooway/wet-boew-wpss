# WPSS Validation Tool version 3.10.0

The WPSS Validation Tool provides web developers and quality assurance testers the ability to perform a number of web site and web page validation tasks at one time. The tool crawls a site to find all of the documents then analyses each document with a number of validation tools.

Version 3.10.0 contains the following updates and additions
  - Include any 'value' attribute content as part of the text between tags (similar to alt text).
  - Remove advisory techniques from WCAG_2.0 testcase profiles.
  - Check for duplicate headings in document sections (e.g. navigation, main content) rather than across the entire HTML page.
  - If a site analysis is stopped/aborted, generate results summary on the URLs that have been processed.
  - Add feature report item for Web feeds.

Reminder: The WPSS Tool DOES NOT validate HTML5 markup.
