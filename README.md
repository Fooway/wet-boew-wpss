# WPSS Validation Tool version 3.9.1

The WPSS Validation Tool provides web developers and quality assurance testers the ability to perform a number of web site and web page validation tasks at one time. The tool crawls a site to find all of the documents then analyses each document with a number of validation tools.

Version 3.9.1 contains the following updates and additions
- The tool checks that the proper search URL (i.e. google) is used on PWGSC sites.
- Checks site title values on splash pages.
- Add HTML feature for URLs archived before Oct 2011. These URLs are exempt from the Standard on Web Accessibility.
- Remove check for duplicate dates in news feed entries.
- Convert 2 character language codes to 3 character codes when analysing web feeds.

Reminder: The WPSS Tool DOES NOT validate HTML5 markup.
